//using the conversion program. These could be fixed width or proportional
//fonts. Individual characters do not have to be multiples of 8 bits wide.
//Any width is fine and does not need to be fixed.

//The data bits are packed to minimize data requirements, but the tradeoff
//is that a header is required per character.
